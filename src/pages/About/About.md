Hey there! I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for technology and innovation, specifically the web and distributed software systems. In particular, I specialize in developing performant and scalable web applications using React, Node and Kubernetes.

My personal mission is to leverage Software and Entrepreneurship to create a more compassionate and human-centric future.   

When I'm not coding, I enjoy jamming out to electronic music, popping/urban choreography and calisthenics.
