Hey there! I'm a software engineer helping make the Web more acessible at *[User1st](https://www.user1st.com)*.

I’m interested in technology, and its intersection with design, people and society. My current obsessions are JavaScript, the Web and productivity. 

When I’m not coding, I enjoy calisthenics, reading, and spending way too much time watering at my plants.

To contact me, email me at *[aki.gao@user1st.com](mailto:aki.gao@user1st.com)*. Also checkout my *[resume](https://iknowht.ml/resume)* and *[Github](https://github.com/iknowhtml)*.
