Hey there! I'm a Full Stack JavaScript developer with a passion for technology and innovation. In particular, I specialize in developing performant and scalable web applications using the React and Node ecosystems.

I'm passionate about Software, Entrepreneurship and how to leverage then to best create a more compassionate and humancentric future.   

When I'm not coding, I enjoy jamming out to electronic music, watching anime, and calisthenics.
