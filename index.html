      <h2>
            Hey there! I'm a full stack Javascript developer with a passion for technology and innovation.
            I'm interested in web technologies like React/Redux, PostCSS, Webpack and Node.
            I also enjoy learning about application architecture, devops and the latest tools for web development.
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to music, urban dancing and lifting heavy stuff at the gym.
