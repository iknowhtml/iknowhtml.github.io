      <h2>
          Hey there! I'm a full stack Javascript developer with a passion for technology and innovation.
          I specialize in web technologies such as React/Redux, Webpack, Node/Express, Docker, Terraform and AWS. <br />
          <br />
          I'm currently interested in Cryptocurrency, Blockchain development and Ethereum.
          In my spare time, I enjoy learning about application architecture, devops and the latest tools for web development. <br/>
          <br />
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to electronic music, hip hop and urban dancing and lifting heavy stuff at the gym.
          On the weekends, you can find me looking at art I don't understand and figuring out different ways to burn down my kitchen with new recipes.<br />
          <br />
