            <h2> Hey there, I'm a developer living in Northern Virginia.
           I'm interested in Javascript-based web technologies like React and Node.
            I also enjoy learning about application architecture and devops.
             In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and lifting heavy stuff at the gym.

            <h2><a href="static/cv.html" target="_blank">Resume</a></h2>
            <p>
              Fully responsive resume written entirely in HTML and SCSS.
              Created to afford ease in modifying content and formatting, as well as in order to integrate seemlessly in my personal site.
              Try resizing it!

              A RESTful API for anonymous and temporary file storage.

              Files are also encrypted using AES256 and then stored on AWS S3.
